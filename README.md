### What happens if an invalid number is chosen?

If you select a wrong input such as 11, 12 or a string like "cw1" the following message returns telling you what exactly you did wrong and asking you to submit a number from 1 to 9.

If you select a cell which has already been used to place in X or O, for example, 1, the following message is displayed telling you which cell has already been used and prompting you to choose another one.

### GAME CONCLUSION

WIN

The image below shows an example of a win because there are 3 X's in a diagonal line from the bottom left to top right. As long as there is a line going either vertically, horizontally or diagonally containing 3 same tokens, the game is won and the user with those is the winner.
